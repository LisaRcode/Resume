                            Lynette was always been available for any questions & eager to help me! Due to health
                            issues, I have not gotten her all the information she has needed to finish this process
                            up. I am looking forward to continue working with Lynette . I feel she's honest,

                            data-based proposal for resolution. Lynette stayed in constant communication with me
                            while negotiating with the IRS offer specialist assigned to my case. The ongoing process
                            led to my increasing confidence and comfort level that Lynette would be successful in
