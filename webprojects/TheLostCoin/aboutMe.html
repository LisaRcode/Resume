                <p>
                    Lynette began her accounting career with then prestigious Arthur Andersen & Co as an auditor. She
                    spent nearly 10 years in various internal audit, accounting, and finance positions at
                    Hewlett-Packard Company, and also has extensive experience as a real estate investor. She has
                    prepared hundreds of individual and corporate tax returns and payroll tax filings. More recently,
                    she spent two years in New Orleans performing fraud investigation and forensic accounting work for
                    the largest class-action court ordered settlement program in the history of the United States.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        She also spent nearly a year investigating allegations of embezzlement at a closely-held family
                        business, identifying stolen funds in excess of $1.6 million along with fraudulently filed
                        corporate tax returns and quarterly payroll reports. From her public accounting roots at the
                        largest and
                        most respected global accounting firm in the world to her years in Corporate America to her
                        consulting experience with small family businesses, Lynette has developed a proven track record
                        as a well-rounded finance professional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lynette operates and manages The Lost Coin, LLC, deploying over 30+ years as a Certified Public
                        Accountant (CPA). She has been licensed through the State of Missouri since 2013. She is also a
                        Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) credentialed by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, and
                        she holds a Certificate in Financial Forensics (CFF) through the American Institute of Certified
                        Public Accountants. Lynette obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Accountancy from the
                        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Master of Science degree in Economic Crime
                        Management from Utica College in New York.

            <h2 class="about-center-title">The coming of the lost coin</h2>

            <!-- Centered image under heading -->
            <div class="text-center mb-4">

            </div>

            <p>Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins[a] and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and
                search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together
                and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing
                in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
                -Luke 8-10 NIV</p>
            <p>
                The parable of the lost coin illustrates the diligence and care required to recover what is valuable, no
                matter how small. Just as the woman lights a lamp and searches tirelessly until the coin is found, a
                CPA, CFE, and CFF approaches financial records with the same persistence—tracking discrepancies,
                uncovering hidden truths, and restoring integrity to the numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forensic accounting is about more than balancing books; it is about protecting trust. Each missing entry
                or unexplained transaction can reveal deeper issues, and the joy of resolution mirrors the rejoicing in
                the parable. By treating every detail as significant, this professional ensures accuracy, transparency,
                and justice, bringing clarity where it was once lost.
